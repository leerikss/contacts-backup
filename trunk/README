Build from source:
==================

Option 1:
---------
- Checkout source, and integrate into a NetBeans (with J2ME support) project
- Configure emulators & run using Netbeans auto-generated build scripts

Option 2:
---------
- Checkout source
- Install required tools
  a) Antenna
     - http://antenna.sourceforge.net/
  b) A proper WTK with misc required librarys (midp_2.0.jar,jsr75_1.0,cldc_1.1.jar,etc) 
     and binarys (preverify,emulator,etc). Ex. Java_ME_platform_SDK_3.0
  c) Proguard (for obfuscation)
     - http://proguard.sourceforge.net/
- Change build.xml paths to match your environment
- Build/run manually with "ant run", or from within an IDE (Ex. Eclipse)
